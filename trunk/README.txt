README of libevhdns: evdns implementation compatible with libev
by pts@fazekas.hu at Sat Apr 24 21:56:35 CEST 2010

About
~~~~~
libevhdns is a C library for Unix which implements the asynchronous DNS
resolver evdns (the asynchronous DNS resolving feature of libevent) in a way
which is compatible with both libev and libevent.

libevhdns reuses parts of the libevent source code (including the full
evdns.c) and libevent's configure script. The only extra merit of libevhdns
as compared to libevent is that it works with libev as well.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get the source code from http://code.google.com/p/libevhdns/ .

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

License
~~~~~~~
Since libevent source files are covered by BSD-like licenses, libevhdns is
covered by the New BSD License.

Version number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The version number is defined in the Makefile.in file in the RELEASE
variable. It's the same as version of the libevent the source files have
been copied from.

Which files are from libevent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following files in the source tree libevhdns have been copied verbatim
from libevent-1.4.13.

  config.guess
